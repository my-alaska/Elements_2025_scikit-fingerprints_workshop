    "\n",
    "Scikit-fingerprints is based on the scikit-learn interface (API), which primarily means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Many elements (e.g. molecular fingerprints, filters) are represented as Python classes.\n",
    "2. Constructor parameters control the general behavior, and act as hyperparameters in ML.\n",
    "3. Primary methods are:\n",
    "   - `.fit()` - learn from data, e.g. train model\n",
    "   - `.transform()` - transform data, e.g. turn molecules into feature vectors\n",
    "   - `.predict()` - predict for new data using trained model\n",
    "4. It's fully interoperable with scikit-learn and other libraries in that ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-fingerprints, we primarily use the `.transform()` interface to process molecules. For example, you can:\n",
    "- parse SMILES as `Mol` objects\n",
    "- extract features from molecules, turning `Mol` into NumPy arrays\n",
    "- combine multiple vector representations\n",
    "- tune hyperparameters of this process\n",

    "Peptides are small proteins, which are also therapeutic targets, similar to small compounds. We can also analyze them as molecular graphs, albeit quite large. Still, we can use molecular fingerprints, in particular count variants, that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, as we have shown in our paper [\"Molecular Fingerprints Are Strong Models for Peptide Function Prediction\" J. Adamczyk et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17901)\n",

    "We will use the [dataset by Xu et al.](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/22/5/bbab083/6189771), also known as XUAMP. The task is to predict whether a peptide has antimicrobial properties (AMP) or not. Basically the only difference from prior case is that here amino acid sequences are used instead of the SMILES format.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the XUAMP dataset from `data/xuamp_train.csv` and `data/xuamp_test.csv`.\n",

    "You can also use [scikit-learn Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) for cleaner, shorter code. Scikit-fingerprints is fully integrated with its capabilities. You can provide `verbose=-1` option to `LGBMClassifier` to turn off its logs, which are pretty verbose."
